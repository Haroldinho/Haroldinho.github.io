# Headline
Bridging Aerospace Engineering & Data Science | ML, Analytics, Python | Turning Data Into Impact


# Profile
Aerospace Engineer and Data Scientist with a proven track record of applying statistical modeling, machine learning, and AI to deliver impactful solutions in transportation, demand forecasting, slot scheduling, and video/caption processing. Known for quickly adapting to evolving goals, thriving in fast-paced environments, and collaborating across disciplines to turn complex challenges into actionable results. Committed to continuous learning and innovation.


## Professional Experience

**Warner Bros. Discovery - Data Science – ML**
*Senior Data Science Analyst, Atlanta, GA | May 2020 – Present*

- Designed and productionized a caption positioning module using PaddleOCR, Python, and Kubeflow VertexAI pipelines, improving precision and recall from mid-40% to 90%, and reducing editing time by 10–15% per programming hour.
- Developed an FFT and perceptual hashing-based solution to identify video clip locations within larger assets, achieving 95% temporal accuracy. Enabled rapid prototyping of trailer generation techniques regardless of source production style.
- Evaluated and compared different versions of Google's Gemini VLMs to create an integrated AI workflow that extracts scenes and metadata in production-ready formats. Engineered few-shot prompts with role-based task decomposition and self-criticism strategies.
- Built, containerized, and deployed a Streamlit web application using Docker and Cloud Run to collect user feedback on AI-generated video clips, enabling data-driven model evaluation.
- Designed and implemented a Bayesian Dirichlet update framework to dynamically adjust confidence scores based on user feedback.
- Conducted a proof of concept for metadata generation from video content using multi-step prompting and schema contextualization, improving the precision of automated content labeling.
- Created a detailed cost analysis model for evaluating Visual Language Models (VLMs) based on token usage and inference costs, guiding resource allocation and budget decisions.
- Developed a tool to estimate the best caption position using computer vision tools.
- Mentored summer interns, providing project scoping, technical coaching, and support during final presentations; intern work led to organizational initiatives.
- Created monitoring tools using R and Python in Domino Data Lab and Snowflake for audience forecasting models, identifying opportunities for tool enhancements in 2 of 6 markets.
- Replaced traditional audience forecasting tools with ML-based solutions (XGBoost, Prophet, Regression Forests), reducing error by 5–30%.
- Maintained and upgraded CPLEX-based mixed-integer programming code supporting millions in marketing campaign revenue.
- Assessed data integrity of third-party vendors and communicated findings to both technical and business stakeholders to inform vendor selection decisions within three months.

**Georgia Institute of Technology: Air Transportation Lab**
*Graduate Research Assistant, Atlanta, GA | Aug 2012 – Dec 2021*

- Created a discrete event simulation of airport passenger traffic in C++ to study queue dynamics and detect transient changes using stochastic modeling.
- Predicted wait times with less than 20% error over 15-minute intervals using simulation and flight/cellphone data from Sydney International Airport.
- Streamlined Perl and C++ code for the MEANS software platform, enabling internal adoption.

**Airbus Aerial**

- Developed a MILP optimization tool for multi-drone path planning under time and energy constraints.
- Led a team of three graduate students, delivering a path-planning software solution in under three months.
- Coordinated the development of aerial surveillance heuristics, improving completion time from a week to two days.

**Société Internationale de Télécommunications Aéronautiques (SITA)**

- Processed flight and MAC address data using Python/SQL to analyze longitudinal trends in airport passenger flows.
- Developed and integrated a discrete-event foot traffic simulator into a model-predictive optimization tool.

**Insight Data Science**
*Data Engineer – Fellowship, Seattle, WA | Sep 2019 – Nov 2019*

- Designed a Spark-based batch processing pipeline to analyze 250 GB of Twitter data and extract pricing trends.
- Employed NLP to extract product and price mentions for real-time dashboards.
- Built a PostgreSQL database and S3 backend to serve an interactive dashboard.

**FlightSafety International**
*Part-time Engineer I, Atlanta, GA | May 2015 – Jul 2016*

- Developed a realistic collision-avoidance SATCE simulator by integrating real-world flight data.
- Created a C++ mathematical program for fast and low-level system control.
- Designed a turboprop engine simulation with an 80% cost-effective performance match.

Leadership Experience

**Toastmasters International (WBD Chapter)**
*Sergeant at Arms (2024), Vice President of Education (2025)*

- Increased average meeting attendance from 10 to 30+ participants by organizing distinguished speaker events.
- Spearheaded a mentoring program that paired new speakers with experienced members, boosting participation and confidence.
